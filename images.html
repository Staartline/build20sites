	<h1>Embedding Images using img src</h1>
	<p>We finally begin to learn about embedding images now. <a href="https://www.pexels.com" target="_blank"> Pexels is a good resource for free images online. </a> </p>
	<p>Image Element -> This tag does not wrap anything. You give it the URL of an image that you would like to use, then close the tag.
	You can use external images from another site, or from the file structure of the website.
	Images use a SRC, or a source attribute.  </p>

	<h1>The following photo uses img src, and an external website link</h1>

	<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/270348/pexels-photo-270348.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" alt="Coding on a Screen" width="50%">

	<p>However, the image is quite large, no? Images can also have multiple attrubutes such as alt, for alt text.
		To reduce the size of this image, we can refer to W3Schools <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_width.asp" target="_blank"> here </a> to see that there is a width attribute, to reduce an image size. this is width. Width can take a 50% or a number in pixels. </p>
	<p>It is recommended that a user will manually edit down the image size so that computers do not have to download the whole image.</p>

	<p>You are also able to put images into lists. </p>
	<h1>Images in Lists Example</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/270404/pexels-photo-270404.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" width="500px" alt="HTML">
		</li>
		<li>
			<img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11035547/pexels-photo-11035547.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&w=1260&h=750&dpr=2" width="500px" alt="Java">
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This can be used in CSS Styling, for instance.</p>
