	<title>Baby's First HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>First thing you can do is to change the title. The tutorial has changed theirs to say... "My Cool Site", but I have chosen to write that it is our first HTML.</p>
	<p>First time readers may find it beneficial to RIGHT CLICK and VIEW PAGE SOURCE. </p>
	<p>For any text, we would like to wrap the said text in some element.</p>
	<p>HOT TIP: Make sure to close your tags as you create them. So, if you start a p, close the p right away.</p>

	<h1>Paragraph Example 1</h1>
	<p>My name is Isabel.</p> 
	<p>Welcome to my site.</p>

	<h1>Paragraph Example 2</h1>
	<p>
		Some people may choose to write code with a p tag before and below for longer lines like so. 
		This way, multiple lines are able to be represented using one element.
	</p>
	<p>
		Linebreaks may be written in this manner to provide for space between lines. This is done by using several paragraph elements. 
	</p>

	<h1>Header Examples </h1>
	<h1>H1 is the largest header. It could be thought of as a headline.</h1>
	<h2>H2 is the second largest header. It could be thought of as a lead.</h2>
	<h3>H3 is the third largest. It is more rare to use H3 through H6, but they are available.</h3>
	<h4>H4 is the fourth largest. </h4>
	<h5>H5 is the fifth largest.</h5>
	<h6>H6 is the smallest. This is smaller than a default paragraph.</h6>

	<h1>Nested Elements</h1>
	<p>We are able to have nested elements in HTML. For example, we can emphasize a specific part of a line.</p>
	<p>My name is <strong>Isabel</strong>.</p>
	<p>Strong can put a strong emphasis on certain words, and the paragraph can be continued after the element.</p>
	<p>EM can be used to put an emphasis on words. <em>For example, I used the EM tag here.</em></p>
