		<h1>What is HTML?</h1>
		<p>Hypertext Markup Language</p>
		<p>Used to make webpages -> HTML is a webpage's skeleton, and tells a browser how to display a page.</p>

		<h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
		<p>Such as H1, DIV and p are tags. They might be enclosed between tags such as: < tag> content < \tag>. </p>
		<p>When something is enclosed in such a way, it is an element. </p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Boilerplate</h2>
		<p>Code found on every webpage.</p>
		<p>Usually contains elements such as !Doctype, HTML, TITLE, BODY, and closing tags. </p>
		<p>For example, visit <a href="https://www.example.com" target = "_blank">example.com </a> and view the page source. It should have the aformentioned tags.</p>
		<p>!Doctype HTML - Pages need this to be rendered as HTML. Indicated to the browser.</p>
		<p>HTML - Wraps all content on the page.</p>
		<p>HEAD - This is where we put content that might not be shown to the site visitors. This information might include a link to a CSS sheet or Javascript files. Head might also include the following.</p>
		<p>Meta charset - sets a character set for the website's encoding. UTF-8 Includes most characters.</p>
		<p>Title - Sets the title on the webpage. Visitors can see this on their tabs.</p>
		<p>Body- This is the content that is displayed on the website. This might include DIVs, H1, P, A, and so forth. </p>
		<p>Order is important. Make sure to double check the nest, and close the tags off in a reverse order.</p>
