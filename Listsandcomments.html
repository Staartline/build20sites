	<title>Lists and Comments</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>Lists are common in HTML. For example, a NAV bar can be a list. They are styled using CSS sometimes. It is important to know our skeleton. </p>
	<p>Ordered List - These elements in this list might be numbered, such as steps in a recipie. The order is important here.</p>
	<p>Unordered List - These elements are for things that the order does not matter, such as a shopping list, or ingredients list.</p>
	<h1>Ordered List - OL</h1>
	<p>OL Stands for ordered list. List items are indicated by li. The items here are automatically numbered. as long as elements are added inbetween the OL, the items will be counted. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Add Flour</li>	
		<li>Mix in salt</li>
		<li>Mix in eggs.</li>
	</ol>
	<h1>Unordered List - UL</h1>
	<p>If the order doesn't matter, we use a ul.</p>
	<!-- this is an unordered list example -->
	<ul>
		<li>Eggs</li>
		<li>Milk</li>
		<li>Salt</li>
		<li>Flour</li>

	</ul>
	<h1>Comments</h1>
	<p>Users can add comments to their code. When you learn a new feature, you can add a comment to say what it does. Comments are written as follows < !-- comment -->. In this case, it appears since I left a space there to see, but it will be removed to add in comments. </p>

	<h1>Nested Lists</h1>
	<p>Lists can be nested. For example, for a navi bar.</p>
	<p>This may be a list with a sublist.</p>

	<!--Example of a nested list. The list item can contain another list. The containing list can be ol or ul-->
	<ul>
		<li> Mix eggs with whisk
			<ul>
				<li>Fold in mixture</li>
				<li>Wait 5 minutes</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<!--End of the nested list-->
	<p>Can be used for lists with sublists, but can be difficult to keep track of the list orders. Comments can be used to mark the beginning and the ends of lists and sublists. </p>
